# CobolGL

A small example of how to setup and use a modern OpenGL 4.5 Core context in COBOL using win32 api.
This example uses the Micro Focus Visual COBOL implementation of COBOL.

In order to build and run the example you have to setup MicroFocus Visual COBOL, there is a personal edition that should be available for free [here](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/visual-cobol-personal-edition/overview).

## Why?

I got a new job where I have to be able to be somewhat fluent in COBOL and I thought this would be a fun way of diving learning COBOL.
